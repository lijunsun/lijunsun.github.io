I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/lijun-sun). I received my PhD degree in Civil Engineering (Transportation) from [National University of Singapore](http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/), and earned a Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering from [Tsinghua University](http://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). During my PhD, I worked at Mobility and Transport Planning module at the [Future Cities Laboratory](http://www.fcl.ethz.ch/), Singapore-ETH center. Prior to joining McGill, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). 

My current research centers on the area of smart transportation and urban computing, developing innovative methodologies and applications to address efficiency, resilience, and sustainability issues in urban transportation systems. I am particularly interested in integrating advances in machine learning into human mobility modeling, agent-based simulation, and intelligent transportation systems. My previous work has been featured in some popular media outlets, including Wired, Citylab, Scientific American, and MIT Technology Review.



For Prospective Students/Postdocs
======
* I am looking for one motivated Postdoc Associate to start in 2021 Fall in the general area of machine learning for transportation and urban research. Please send me an email (subject: "Prospective Postdoc Associate [Your name]") with your CV, a brief research statement (one page or less) and transcripts.
* I am looking for 1-2 PhD students for 2021 Fall and 2022 Winter (Spring) who are excited about machine learning for smart transportation. If you're interested, please send me an email or apply through the [McGill uApply](https://www.mcgill.ca/uapply) system. Please use "Prospective PhD student [Your name]" as your email subject. Due to the large volume of emails, I apologize for not replying to individual inquries I have received. 
* See [more info about Civil Engineering @ McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/grad).
* Ben Barres' advice on [How to Pick a Graduate Advisor](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2013.10.005).
* If you have a good record in mathematics/machine learning, you are encouraged to apply for the [IVADO graduate student scholarship](https://ivado.ca/en/excellence-scholarships/).
* Postdocs or final year PhD students with strong mathematics/machine learning background (and also application in smart transportation, e.g., spatiotemporal prediction, generative model for urban activity) are __strongly encouraged__ to apply for the [IVADO postdoc scholarship](https://ivado.ca/en/ivado-scholarships/postdoctoral-scholarships/). Very competitive package!
